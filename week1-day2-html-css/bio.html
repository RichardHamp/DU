                <p>My name is Voltron. I am a semi-sentient giant robot composed of five distinct smaller robotic lions. Once upon a time, I was whole and awesome instead of a mishmash of five lions. I saved universe by my damn self repeatedly--without pilots or whatever. However, I maybe kinda got a bit full of myself and picked a fight with a benevolent cosmic god-being and they broke me into five parts. Don't care how good the god-being is suppose to be, that was straight-up bullying. Now I am saddled with a bunch of squishy human pilots (don't get me started on Pidge...he/she is the worst) when my advanced AI could have solved this whole King Zarkon issue permanent-like in minutes.           </p>
